<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I consider myself to be a scholar with focus in interested in the overlap of cryptography and distributed systems. I first got interested in cryptography during my bachelor at the University of Oviedo, Spain. It was in Oviedo where I got started in research, in particular in experimental particle physics with the detector CMS. My interest in cryptography broadened during my master at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. After that, I completed my PhD in distributed systems under the supervision of <a href="https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Christian Cachin</a> at the University of Bern, Switzerland. During my PhD, I had the opportunity to to do an internship at Google Cambridge, USA, with <a href="https://shelat.khoury.northeastern.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">abhi shelat</a>.</p> <p>Outside research, I am a person who enjoys a simple life. I take pleasure in in morning walks, sports, dinners with friends, and boardgames. I am also known as Nacho, Nacho is the standard nickname for Ignacio but much easier to pronounce by non-native people.</p> </body></html>
