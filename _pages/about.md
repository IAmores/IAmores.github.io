I consider myself to be a scholar with focus in interested in the overlap of cryptography and distributed systems. I first got interested in cryptography during my bachelor at the University of Oviedo, Spain. It was in Oviedo where I got started in research, in particular in experimental particle physics with the detector CMS. My interest in cryptography broadened during my master at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. After that, I completed my PhD in distributed systems under the supervision of [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/) at the University of Bern, Switzerland. During my PhD, I had the opportunity to to do an internship at Google Cambridge, USA, with [abhi shelat](https://shelat.khoury.northeastern.edu/). 

Outside research, I am a person who enjoys a simple life. I take pleasure in in morning walks, sports, dinners with friends, and boardgames. I am also known as Nacho, Nacho is the standard nickname for Ignacio but much easier to pronounce by non-native people.
